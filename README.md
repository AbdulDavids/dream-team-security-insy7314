## Project Overview

This application is a secure payment processing platform that allows employees to submit payment requests and administrators to verify and approve them. The system prioritizes security at every layer, implementing multiple defense mechanisms to protect sensitive financial data and prevent common attack vectors.

### Key Features

- Employee payment submission with validation
- Admin payment verification workflow
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- Real-time HTTPS/TLS status indicators
- Input sanitization and validation
- Session management
- CSRF protection
- Security headers implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulDavids/dream-team-security-insy7314.git
cd dream-team-security-insy7314
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env-example .env.local
```
Then edit `.env.local` and add your values:
- `ATLAS_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string for session encryption

### Development Server

#### HTTP Mode (Default)
```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm run dev:http
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### HTTPS Mode (Recommended for Testing Security Features)

**One-time setup:**
```bash
npm run tls:setup
```
This generates self-signed certificates in `certs/`. Trust the certificate in your OS/browser to avoid warnings.

**Run with HTTPS:**
```bash
npm run dev:https
```
Open [https://localhost:3443](https://localhost:3443) (HTTP port 3000 will auto-redirect)

**Quick HTTPS toggle:**
```bash
npm run dev -- --https
```

### Security Banner

Every page displays a real-time indicator showing whether HTTPS + TLS is active, so you always know if your interactions are secure.

### Video Demo

Watch our demonstration of generating self-signed certificates and running the application locally with HTTPS + TLS:

> [!CAUTION]
> Because the certificates are self-signed, you will need to trust the certificate in your browser or OS to avoid warnings when running the application locally with HTTPS + TLS. Just click on the `advanced` button and then `proceed to localhost (unsafe)` to bypass the warning. You can also [add the certificate to your trust store](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3505249?hl=en) to avoid the warning.

## Login Credentials

### Employee Account
```
Employee ID: EMP001
Password:    Password123!
```

### Admin Account
```
Employee ID: ADMIN001
Password:    AdminPass123!
```

> **Note:** These are demo credentials for development only. Never use default credentials in production.

## CI/CD & DevSecOps

### GitHub Actions Security Pipeline

We've implemented automated security checks using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/devsecops.yml`):

- **Dependency Vulnerability Audit**: Scans npm packages for known vulnerabilities using `npm audit`
- **CodeQL Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues
- **Automated Security Reports**: Results published to GitHub Security tab

### Vercel Preview Deployments

Every pull request automatically deploys a preview environment on Vercel with:
- Automatic HTTPS/TLS certificates
- Production-like security configurations
- Integrated with GitHub Actions security checks

## Security Implementation

### 1. HTTPS & TLS Encryption

**What is HTTPS?**
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**How TLS Works:**
- **Handshake:** Client and server negotiate encryption algorithms and exchange keys
- **Authentication:** Server presents a digital certificate to prove identity
- **Encryption:** Symmetric encryption secures all subsequent data transmission
- **Integrity:** Data is hashed to detect tampering

**Our Implementation:**
- Self-signed certificates for local development (`certs/localhost-cert.pem`, `certs/localhost-key.pem`)
- Custom HTTPS development server with automatic HTTPâ†’HTTPS redirect
- Visual security indicator showing real-time TLS status
- Vercel deployment uses automatic SSL/TLS certificates in production

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **RegEx Patterns:** Validate account numbers, SWIFT codes, and payment amounts
- **Whitelist Validation:** Only allow specific formats for sensitive fields
- **XSS Prevention:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent script injection
- **SQL Injection Protection:** Parameterized queries and input validation

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Secure, stateless authentication
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with salt for password storage
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Separate employee and admin permissions
- **Session Management:** Secure token storage and refresh mechanisms

### 4. Security Headers

Implemented via `next.config.js` and middleware:
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Prevents XSS attacks
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Enforces HTTPS
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls referrer information

### 5. Rate Limiting & CSRF Protection

- Request throttling to prevent brute force attacks
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Secure cookie configurations (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

### 6. Secure Database Practices

- Connection string encryption
- Prepared statements for queries
- Secure credential storage (environment variables)
- Regular data validation
